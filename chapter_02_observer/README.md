# Design Pattern - Observer
**Observer** pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Things to note...
- When the state of one object changes, all of its dependents are notified
- This pattern provides an object design where subjects and observers are loosely coupled
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Loosely coupled designes allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects
